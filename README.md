# fixguard-client
1. Set up a WAMP server with PHP 5 (I used version 2.5)
2. Clone this repo to "C:\www", the default webroot dir.
3. Open "request.php" and edit the $host var to the url of the api request (for example "http://192.168.1.84/fixguard/rest/charterers/charterer/")
  -Do NOT forget the '/' at the end.
4. Visit localhost on your browser and log in with any username and password (I don't check).
